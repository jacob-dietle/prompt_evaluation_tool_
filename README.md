## Features:

- Interactive UI for inputting prompt templates and variables
- Support for multiple placeholders in prompts
- JSON variable upload functionality
- Dynamic creation of input fields based on detected placeholders

## Import Notes & Usage:

**Setting Variables:** You can either insert variables manually via the table or upload a JSON file. When uploading variables as a JSON file, use the following format:

```
{
  "placeholder_name": {
    "type": "single",
    "value": "single_value"
  },
  "another_placeholder": {
    "type": "array",
    "values": ["value1", "value2", "value3"]
  }
}
```

**Placeholder Max:** The tool supports up to 5 placeholders in a single prompt template. You can change this to an arbitrary number, it was just required to enable the dynamic creation of placeholder tabs in the uI.
